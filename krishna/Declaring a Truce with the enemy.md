# Samudramanthan: A lesson in declaring truce with the enemy

Time is an energy of the lord, when time is on side of demigods , these gods flourish when time is on side of demons , the demons flourish. Time rotates in cycles and is never on permanent side of the demons.  One such incident happened : Time was in favor of demons due to which demigods were powerless in front of demons and losing wars and getting killed by demons. They, were completely anxious, as for a long time they were constantly defeated by demons. The demigods prayed to the lord :

**My Lord, we, the various demigods, the directors of this universe, have come to Your lotus feet. Please fulfill the purpose for which we have come. You are the witness of everything, from within and without. Nothing is unknown to You, and therefore it is unnecessary to inform You again of anything. O Supreme Lord, please give us the means of deliverance that is suitable for the brāhmaṇas and demigods.**

**In a deep voice that resembled the rumbling of clouds, the Lord replied to the demigods, who all stood there attentively with folded hands. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and other demigods, please hear Me with great attention, for what I say will bring good fortune for all of you : 

**As long as you are not flourishing, you should make a truce with the demons and asuras, who are now being favored by time. O demigods, fulfilling one’s own interests is so important that one may even have to make a truce with one’s enemies. For the sake of one’s self-interest, one has to act according to the logic of the snake and the mouse.**

* *logic of the snake and the mouse (backstory) : A snake and a mouse were once caught in a basket. Now, since the mouse is food for the snake, this was a good opportunity for the snake. However, since both of them were caught in the basket, even if the snake ate the mouse, the snake would not be able to get out. Therefore, the snake thought it wise to make a truce with the mouse and ask the mouse to make a hole in the basket so that both of them could get out. The snake’s intention was that after the mouse made the hole, the snake would eat the mouse and escape from the basket through the hole. This is called the logic of the snake and the mouse.

**My dear demigods, with patience and peace everything can be done, but if one is agitated by anger, the goal is not achieved. Therefore, whatever the demons ask, agree to their proposal.**

After that samudramanthan was carried out, during which :

**Thereafter, a horse named Uccaiḥśravā, which was as white as the moon, was generated. Bali Mahārāja desired to possess this horse, and Indra, the King of heaven, did not protest, for he had previously been so advised by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

And eventually as samudramanthan progressed the lord took Mohini avatar and helped the demigods to secure nectar and then demigods defeated the demons.
