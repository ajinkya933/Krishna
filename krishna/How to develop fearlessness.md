# How to live in fearlessness

**When Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva saw the small boy Prahlāda Mahārāja prostrated at the soles of His lotus feet, He became most ecstatic in affection toward His devotee. Raising Prahlāda, the Lord placed His lotus hand upon the boy’s head because His hand is always ready to create fearlessness in all of His devotees.**

One characteristic of this material world is that it is full of anxiety, there is a constant state of fear that everyone lives in. This is a fact, no one is free from fear. In modern day civilization many successful people/ influencers/ motivational speakers tell us that "accept this fear, as a part of your journey and learn to live with it. You cannot overcome fear as its a part of your journey and you have to accept it and move ahead in life."  

The truth is that we are sons of God in spirit. God who is epitome of infinite bravery and courage. If the father is  epitome of infinite bravery and courage, why should the son be fearful of anything ? 

One should know and accept this truth and ignore the modern day logics because the logic posted by modern day scholars /influencers/ motivational speakers highlighted above is misleading, and doesn't give a concreate solution. Following such logics in life manifests in symptom of more and more anxiety for the follower. 

Lord on other hand is always ready to to create fearlessness in all his devotees, for he is the only one who can do this. If we surrender to the lord and offer our sincere prayers daily, with time span we will develop a complete sense of fearlessness, as prayers strengths our bond with the lord. Once this bond is strengthened, symptom of fear is diminished. And with regular prayers, fear is completely vanished.
