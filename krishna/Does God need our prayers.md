# Is God so egoistic that he wants everyone to praise him ?

**The Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always fully satisfied in Himself. Therefore when something is offered to Him, the offering, by the Lord’s mercy, is for the benefit of the devotee, for the Lord does not need service from anyone. To give an example, if one’s face is decorated, the reflection of one’s face in a mirror is also seen to be decorated.**

God does not need our prayers, as he is supreme enjoyer of everything. With or without our prayers he is fully satisfied in himself. Then why pray ?

We are the image of God, here an example is given where if you decorate your face, the image in mirror also gets decorated, similarly if we satisfy lord his image (us) we gets all the benefits. 

So we have to pray for our benefit only.
