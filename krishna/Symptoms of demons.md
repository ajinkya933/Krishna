# What is the nature of demons

**One whose mind and senses are uncontrolled becomes increasingly attached to family life because of insatiable lusty desires and very strong illusion. In such a madmanâ€™s life, the remaining years are also wasted because even during those years he cannot engage himself in devotional service.**

In Vedic culture, classification of a person is based on symptoms that he exhibits, for example if :
- A person who has uncontrolled senses and mind 
- Has extreme attachment to family due to his never ending lusty desires 
- Is attached to family life under strong illusion

Vedic culture says this person is demon, and he wastes this human life which is meant for understanding the universal truths (ataho brahma jigyasa) and devotional service to god.
