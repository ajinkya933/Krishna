# Fruits of pious activities

Even though a person who has no assets in pious activities performs some good deed, it will have no result. 

Hence one has to understand that, if he has not done his sadhana towards the lord , daily for a long period of time. And not tried to purify his consciousness daily for a long period of time. If such a person does few small good deeds once in a while they don't have any effect on the result. Whatever good deeds he performs will have no tangible results on the outcome.
