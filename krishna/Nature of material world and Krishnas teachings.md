This life is very dense, other worlds are not this dense. There is a strong gravity that ties relationships, circumstances, action-reaction, piety and sin. You are immediately pulled into with strong force and kept bound to different circumstances and people ( mother father wife kids)  the bond is so strong that it seems impossible to escape.Living with this degree of attachment pulls your 'self' down from liberated plane and strongly attaches yourself to relationships in this world. So living with this kind of gravity towards situations and action- reaction is extremely hard. Life on earth is bounding and one of the toughest life to live on as the 'self' is pulled and kept limited by dense layer of relationships and numerous other criterias.

This is a bonded existence designed to restrict the 'self' from all the freedom that it deserves. It feels criminal and defying the fundamental rights of the self to be put in a place that strips down all his freedom. None of what you see here is real. It's all designed to restrict you.

The more your attachment to a person increases the denser this experience ( life on earth) becomes and more and more pull you experience. This gives high anxiety. 

The fact is if we train the mind according to scriptures we can experience our orignal constitutional state of freedom. Treat scriptures as only hope to re establish oneself into one's free position. 

The best we can do is what Krishna asked us to do in Gita. Gita is all about how I should act . It's not about how others should have acted. This is the core principle of Gita. 

But Gita doesn't tell how my relationship should be with my wife, parents, co-workers, profession and society. For that we can copy Krishnas behaviour from Bhagwatam. We can copy how Krishna acted in these situations which is elaborately explained in Bhagwatam. 

Note that even there the focus is entirely on how I should act in different circumstances. It's all about how I should act. Bhagwatam and Gita never preaches on how other people should act with me.

This highlights a higher core principle: when our Karmas are analysed on our death ( to identify our next life ) they are completely analysed on how I behaved in these situations. Our Karmas are never analysed on how others behaved with me ( you can verify this by seeing many peoples near death experience, when they go through life review, they see how their actions caused ripples. They will never see how others should have acted with them) 

Interactions with wife: 

Bhagwatam Canto 1 text 10:30

All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without individuality and without purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed Personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always pleased their hearts by making valuable presentations.

As husband of so many wives, He pleased them all with presentations, even at a costly endeavor. He brought the pārijāta plant from heaven and implanted it at the palace of Satyabhāmā

Conclusion: Don't let your wife feel alone. You should please your wife's heart.

To do this you will yourself have to face discomfort :  Once Satyabhama (Krishna's wife) expressed her desire to Krishna to bring a celestial tree from Indra and place it in her garden. Even though there was no logical need for Satyabhama of that tree.But, Krishna did not argue logically with satyabhama, when she raised an absurd ask of bringing indras tree just because she wanted it. Krishna went and  fought with indra just to bring celestial parijata tree to satyabhama and pleased her heart.

Satyabhamas chapter also gives a core look into nature of women, and how Krishna dealt with this nature
