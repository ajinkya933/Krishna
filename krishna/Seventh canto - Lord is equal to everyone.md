# Is God is partial to particular group of individuals

The material world is made of three gunas (goodness, passion and ignorance). All these three gunas belong to the material world, and do not even touch the supreme lord, who resides in the spiritual world. When quality of goodness is prominent at that time saints flourish ( during this time people situated in mode of passion and mode of ignorance have a  tough time ). Similarly, when the mode of passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when ignorance is prominent the Yakṣas and Rākṣasas flourish.
