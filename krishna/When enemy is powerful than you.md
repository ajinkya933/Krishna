# Jarāsandha : A lesson in fighting against stronger enemies

King Yudhiṣṭhira was performing rajasuya yadna ( a type of ceremony where where the king wants to expand his empire, so he send envoys to other nations to convince other nations to accept his rule and pay taxes.  And, those who defy him, there is war declared against that kingdom ). 

King Yudhiṣṭhira was very anxious, when he heard that King Jarāsandha of Magadha did not accept his sovereignty. The reason for his anxiety was Jarāsandha was very strong and commanded a large army. Jarāsandha had imprisoned many Kings to perform human sacrifice to lord Rudra, In order to defeat Jarāsandha,  Krishna Instructed Yudhiṣṭhira as follows: 

- One should not fight directly with the opponent, who is more powerful than you.  
- Similar to how we don't know weather we are doing to die in the day or at night ( implies: no one is sure about the time of his death ). We haven't heard of anyone who has become immortal by not fighting.
- Brave men should fight just for satisfying their heart.

So, Krishna wants us to fight even if the enemy is stronger than us. But how can we do this ? lets analyze.

## Nature of this enemy

Such enemies are immature in nature and are engaged only in their own self-interest. Such, a enemy takes tasks without thinking or understanding its consequences. 

## Strategy

Without confrontation its not possible to know weather one is capable of winning. We should attack the enemies as per the strategy given in scriptures. Scriptures say there are three outcomes as follows:

### Success
- A task succeeds when the strategy is good and there are no obstacles.
	- Attacking the opponents vulnerabilities and hiding ones own vulnerabilities gives victory
- Do not accept honors from your enemy
- Do not disregard strengths of your enemy, there are men who have more strength than you.
- If the opponent has become weak, the fight should be ended quickly.

### No one is victorious 
- If you and your opponent both have a doubts on each of your strategies. None of you is victorious

### Defeat
- If you step in a battle without any strategy. You will meet a crushing defeat.
- Disregarding your enemies strength leads to a certain defeat. 
- Inaction due to having doubts about ones own capability results in defeat
