# What is false worship of God

**My dear friends, O sons of the demons, you cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by becoming perfect brāhmaṇas, demigods or great saints or by becoming perfectly good in etiquette or vast learning. None of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the Lord. Nor by charity, austerity, sacrifice, cleanliness or vows can one satisfy the Lord. The Lord is pleased only if one has unflinching, unalloyed devotion to Him. Without sincere devotional service, everything is simply a show.**

In todays world we see many places where people do:
- Charity to satisfy the lord
- Austerity and sacrifice to satisfy the lord
- The remain clean and take vows to satisfy the lord
- Change their profession and become saint or brahman to satisfy the lord

Usually these people are very proud to claim that we did this for the lord, we did that for the lord, we built all these structures for the lord. 

Prahlad says all this is just a show, as the lord is pleased by unflinching devotional service to him. If one has not developed pure devotional service to God, all these points are useless.
