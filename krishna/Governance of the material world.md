# Architecture of Material world

The teachers Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka instructed Prahlāda Mahārāja in the three kinds of material advancement called religion, economic development and sense gratification. Prahlāda, however, being situated above such instructions, did not like them, for such instructions are based on the duality of worldly affairs, which involve one in a materialistic way of life marked by birth, death, old age and disease.

Material world is based on principals of duality, and had following points as fundamental towards its composition:
- Religion (Hindu, Muslim, Cristian, Buddhism etc.)
- Economic development
- Sense gratification
