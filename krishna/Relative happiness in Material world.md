# Duality of Happiness and distress

**Prahlāda Mahārāja continued: My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one’s past fruitive activities. Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress.**

The material world is run on basis of relativity. Whether a person experiences (happiness or distress) depends on how sense object interact on contact with his body. 

For example:
(sense object)           (sense organ)                    (result)
spicy food                 tongue, eyes, nose            happiness (dependent on your acquired taste)
crowded family         eyes, tongue (speech)       distress (depending on your nature)

If you compare above examples the conditions of (happiness and distress) are relative to the observer. What Happiness is for one, Is indeed distress for the other . Which proves that Happiness OR Distress are not absolute truths, they are just relative conditions dependent on nature of observer.
